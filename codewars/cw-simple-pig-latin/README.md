# Maskify

## Question

Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.
```

Examples
pigIt('Pig latin is cool'); // igPay atinlay siay oolcay
pigIt('Hello world !');     // elloHay orldway !

```
